    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through a practical example of enriching a text dataset using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) using [SageMaker Ground Truth](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/). We will start with the [samsum dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Samsung/samsum) from Hugging Face for instruction-based fine-tuning with human feedback. You will begin by downloading the dataset, which consists of conversational dialogues and summaries. From there, you will enrich each data record by inserting a unique task ID that will help track each item during the human feedback process. Finally, you will convert the dataset into a format compatible with Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth [input manifest format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-input-data-input-manifest.html) to ensure it can be used for human annotation tasks. By the end of this section, you will have a fully prepared dataset that can be sent to Ground Truth for collecting human feedback on the summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth provides labeling workflows for humans to work on image and text classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation labeling jobs. You can also build custom workflows to define the user interface (UI) for data labeling jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, Amazon SageMaker provides [custom templates](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-task-uis/tree/master) for image, text, and audio data labeling jobs. These templates use the Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth crowd HTML elements, which simplify building data labeling UIs. You can also specify your own HTML for the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a workflow for creating a refined dataset that combines machine-generated summaries with human insights, potentially leading to more effective and context-aware summarization models. Let's dive in!"
